# workflows

A collection of personal workflows for different types of projects. All work is mine unless indicated otherwise.

## gobp (Go)

["Becca"](https://github.com/rebeccajae) is an extremely talented programmer and all-around amazing human. I go to her for advice, and find her coding and workflows to be exemplary. This is by far my favorite boilerplate for writing Go due to its neat organization, simplicity, and scalability.

## mevnbp (Vue / JavaScript)

I did a Vue project for a freelance client once. This is the corpse of said project. I have some house cleaning to do here. Personally, I prefer React.

## ofxAddonBp (C++)

Docs on how to structure and publish openFrameworks addons are convoluted and out of date. This is a simple starting point. I need to get around to walking the walk and actually write the README.

## react-audio-worklet-example (JavaScript / Web Audio API)

Companion to the Medium article ["Implementing AudioWorklets with React"](https://medium.com/hackernoon/implementing-audioworklets-with-react-8a80a470474).

## responsive-react-canvas (React / JavaScript / Canvas API)
I might be a little bit biased, but this is by far my favorite workflow for Canvas API projects. Minimize boilerplate and get mobile responsiveness out-of-the-box!

## socket-wrench (React / JavaScript / Express / Socket.IO / State Management Strategy)
My most up-to-date workflow for full-stack JavaScript applications. See ["Not Another React State Management Article!"](https://medium.com/@spidercatnat/not-another-react-state-management-article-9dfbfab0a077)
