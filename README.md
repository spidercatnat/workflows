# workflows

A collection of personal workflows for different types of projects. All work is mine unless indicated otherwise.

## Go
### gobp

[Becca](https://github.com/rebeccajae) is an extremely talented programmer and all-around amazing human. I go to her for advice, and find her coding and workflows to be exemplary. This is by far my favorite boilerplate for writing Go due to its neat organization, simplicity, and scalability.

## JavaScript 
### mevnbp

I did a Vue project for a freelance client once. This is the corpse of said project. I have some house cleaning to do here. Personally, I prefer React.

### socket-wrench
My most up-to-date workflow for full-stack JavaScript applications. See [Not Another React State Management Article!](https://medium.com/@spidercatnat/not-another-react-state-management-article-9dfbfab0a077)

## C++
### ofxAddonBp
Docs on how to structure and publish openFrameworks addons are convoluted and out of date. This is a simple starting point. I need to get around to walking the walk though, and actually write the README.

## Python
I use Anaconda and Jupyter Notebooks like the rest of you ;-)
